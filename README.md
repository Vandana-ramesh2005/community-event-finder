### Project Description
[Our project is a Community Event Finder web application designed to help users discover events happening nearby. The frontend provides filters for categories, places, districts, and time ranges, while the backend (running on Node.js) connects to APIs like Google Maps to fetch and display location‑based results. In short, it’s a location‑aware event discovery tool that combines search, mapping, and user interaction features.]

### The Problem statement
[The problem your project is solving is that people often struggle to discover local events happening around them in real time. Information is scattered across social media, word of mouth, or fragmented platforms, making it difficult to know what’s happening nearby. Your Community Event Finder addresses this by providing a centralized, location‑aware tool where users can search by place, category, and radius to quickly find events in their area.]

### The Solution
[The solution you’re building is a Community Event Finder platform that centralizes event discovery into one accessible tool. You solve the problem by creating a web application with a frontend interface for searching and filtering events (by category, place, district, and time radius) and a backend service connected to APIs like Google Maps to provide location‑based results. By combining these, users can quickly find nearby events without relying on scattered sources, making event discovery simple, interactive, and reliable.]

#### Screenshots (Add at least 3)

![docs/Screenshot 2026-02-20 214444.png](Add screenshot 1 here with proper name)
*The platform enables users to discover nearby events through location-based search, distance filtering, interactive map visualization, real-time GPS detection, and navigation support via Leaflet and Google Maps.*

![docs/Screenshot 2026-02-20 214503.png](Add screenshot 2 here with proper name)
*The platform allows registered users to add new events by entering event details and selecting the exact location on the map, which is then stored in the database through a Flask backend.*

![docs/Screenshot 2026-02-20 214524.png](Add screenshot 3 here with proper name)
*When a user clicks **“Interested,”** the system pins the event’s exact location on an interactive map using Leaflet and provides navigation directions via Google Maps.*

![<docs/Screenshot 2026-02-20 214554.png>]
*The system displays all available events and allows users to filter them based on their preferred location and selected distance radius to find nearby events.*

![<docs/Screenshot 2026-02-20 214621.png>]
*The front page provides filtering options that allow users to select district, area, category, and distance to easily find events that match their preferences.*


#### Diagrams

**System Architecture:**

![Architecture Diagram](docs/WhatsApp Image 2026-02-21 at 10.04.50 AM.jpeg)
*Our system is a location-based event platform that follows a simple three-layer architecture: frontend, backend, and database. The frontend displays events on an interactive map using Leaflet.js, gets the user’s location through GPS, and allows users to search, filter, register, and add new events. It sends requests to the Flask backend, which handles user authentication, processes event data, and applies filtering logic. The backend communicates with the database to store and retrieve user and event information, and then sends the results back to the frontend in JSON format. Google Maps API is integrated for navigation. This structure ensures smooth communication between components and efficient event management.*
